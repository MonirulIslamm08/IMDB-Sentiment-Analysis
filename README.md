🎭 IMDB Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It explores various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning with LSTMs.

Features
✅ Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations
✅ Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF Vectorization
✅ Word2Vec Embeddings
✅ Model Training & Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
✅ Deep Learning with LSTM for Text Classification
✅ Deployment with Flask API

Dataset 📂
The dataset used is the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, containing 50,000 labeled reviews (positive/negative).
